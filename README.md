1.) When you click on Vesper Brothers Foods I think it should either open in a new window with that target = _blank thing or have a link to get back to your home site (prob the new window) because when you click on links on vesper brothers only way to get to yours is to click back arrow a bunch of times
2.) I love the uniform of the site, that it flows really nice and is connected to all parts of your life currently, but that it will be easy to fill in with your projects as they come
3.) Nit picky and more design then anything else... your "home, about contact links" in your nav are pretty small, and then when you go to those sites that heading is so large it takes away from the content and your pictures a bit... i like the big facebook, github, twitter icons in the footer, but there is part of me that thinks your name should be hte focus and its not... maybe even just putting it up above the home, about, contact or try the nav across the top instead of down the side (even though i really like the side) just something to make it pop a bit
4.) your code is really clean, like form a textbook and very easy to read i really appreciate that... i feel sometimes people want to write it in a confusing way to show how 'smart' they are or how much they know and it doesn't help anyone... yours is very nice to follow
